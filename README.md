# SimpleAutoClicker
A very basic auto clicker for windows 11

## Prerequisites:
Python 3.7+
Install the required libraries:
`pip install tkinter pynput`

### Features:
- **Standard Click Mode:**
  Automates regular right-clicks at specified intervals.
- **Enter Key Mode:**
  Automates clicking using the Enter key, along with a custom sequence (e.g., holding the Enter key for a specified duration).
- **Custom Sequences:**
  Choose from predefined click and hold sequences to control the behavior of the clicks.
- **Program Selector:**
Allows you to select and focus on any open program for the auto-clicker to operate on.
Draggable Click Point Button: Set the click position anywhere on the screen by dragging and placing the button.
- **Start and Stop Buttons:**
Control the automation through the GUI or the Enter key to start, and the Esc key to immediately stop. (although the Esc to stop seems to be rather broken..)

I haven't created a system for creating custom sequences,
so if thats what you need you'll need to code it into the program.
I've already made one that you can find in the program.
So just do what I did for your own sequence.

Im not planning on updating this. Just wanted to share this 
in case someone else needed a very basic AutoClicker for win 11.
