# SimpleAutoClicker
A very basic auto clicker for windows 11

## Prerequisites:
Python 3.7+
Install the required libraries:
`pip install pyautogui keyboard pywin32`

### Features:
- **SubMenu** I've added a submenu to every 'drag me' you add. You can access this by right clicking on one of them, here you can set
all the different parameters such as what key to press, if you want it to be held down or not, how long to hold it down and of course
a delete button.
- **Custom Sequences:**
  You can now save your own sequences by hitting save although this feature is a WIP since it only stores position data and not submenu info.
- **Program Selector:**
Allows you to select and focus on any open program for the auto-clicker to operate on.
Draggable Click Point Button: Set the click position anywhere on the screen by dragging and placing the button.
- **Start and Stop Buttons:**
Control the automation through the GUI or the Enter key to start, and the Esc key to immediately stop. (if it doesn't stop when you hit enter its because its in the middle of performing an action just keep pressing esc and it will stop when its done.)

Im not planning on updating this. Just wanted to share this 
in case someone else needed a very basic AutoClicker for win 11.
