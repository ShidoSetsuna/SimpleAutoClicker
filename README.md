# SimpleAutoClicker
A very basic auto clicker for windows 11

## Prerequisites:
Python 3.7+
Install the required libraries:
`pip install tkinter pynput win32gui`

### Features:
- **Standard Click Mode:**
  Automates regular right/left-clicks at specified intervals.
- **Enter Key Mode:**
  Automates clicking using the Enter key, along with a custom sequence (e.g., holding the Enter key for a specified duration).
- **Custom Sequences:**
  Choose from predefined click and hold sequences to control the behavior of the clicks.
- **Program Selector:**
Allows you to select and focus on any open program for the auto-clicker to operate on.
Draggable Click Point Button: Set the click position anywhere on the screen by dragging and placing the button.
- **Start and Stop Buttons:**
Control the automation through the GUI or the Enter key to start, and the Esc key to immediately stop. (although the Esc to stop seems to be rather broken..)
- **Add Click Button**
INSANE NEW FEATURE, Yes, believe it or not, you can now add MULITPLE for action buttons CRAZY RIGHT?!?! BUT HOLD ON THERES MORE!
YES, THATS RIGHT. YOU CAN DELETE AN ACTION BUTTON BY RIGHT CLICKING ON IT!

Jokes aside, I hope at least one person finds this helpful. Oh and a quick note, of course even though I call these buttons click buttons or whatever each button can be used as a hold of course. You just still need to manually set it because I haven't made a system for it YET.

I haven't created a system for creating custom sequences,
so if thats what you need you'll need to code it into the program.
I've already made one that you can find in the program.
So just do what I did for your own sequence.

Im not planning on updating this. Just wanted to share this 
in case someone else needed a very basic AutoClicker for win 11.
